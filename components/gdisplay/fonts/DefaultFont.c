// This data structure was designed to support Proportional fonts
// fonts. Individual characters do not have to be multiples of 8 bits wide.
// Any width is fine and does not need to be fixed.

// The data bits are packed to minimize data requirements, but the tradeoff
// is that a header is required per character.

// Header Format:
// ------------------------------------------------
// Character Width (Used as a marker to indicate use this format. i.e.: = 0x00)
// Character Height
// First Character (Reserved. 0x00)
// Number Of Characters (Reserved. 0x00)

// Individual Character Format:
// ----------------------------
// Character Code
// Adjusted Y Offset
// Width
// Height
// xOffset
// xDelta (the distance to move the cursor. Effective width of the character.)
// Data[n]

// NOTE: You can remove any of these characters if they are not needed in
// your application. The first character number in each Glyph indicates
// the ASCII character code. Therefore, these do not have to be sequential.
// Just remove all the content for a particular character to save space.
