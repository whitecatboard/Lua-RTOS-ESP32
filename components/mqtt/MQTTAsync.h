 *
 * &copy; Copyright IBM Corp. 2009, 2017
 *
 * @brief An Asynchronous MQTT client library for C.
 *
 * An MQTT client application connects to MQTT-capable servers.
 * A typical client is responsible for collecting information from a telemetry
 * device and publishing the information to the server. It can also subscribe
 * to topics, receive messages, and use this information to control the
 * telemetry device.
 *
 * MQTT clients implement the published MQTT v3 protocol. You can write your own
 * API to the MQTT protocol using the programming language and platform of your
 * choice. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.
 *
 * To simplify writing MQTT client applications, this library encapsulates
 * the MQTT v3 protocol for you. Using this library enables a fully functional
 * MQTT client application to be written in a few lines of code.
 * The information presented here documents the API provided
 * by the Asynchronous MQTT Client library for C.
 *
 * <b>Using the client</b><br>
 * Applications that use the client library typically use a similar structure:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a client object</li>
 * <li>Set the options to connect to an MQTT server</li>
 * <li>Set up callback functions</li>
 * <li>Connect the client to an MQTT server</li>
 * <li>Subscribe to any topics the client needs to receive</li>
 * <li>Repeat until finished:</li>
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>Publish any messages the client needs to</li>
 *     <li>Handle any incoming messages</li>
 *     </ul>
 * <li>Disconnect the client</li>
 * <li>Free any memory being used by the client</li>
 * </ul>
 * Some simple examples are shown here:
 * <ul>
 * <li>@ref publish</li>
 * <li>@ref subscribe</li>
 * </ul>
 * Additional information about important concepts is provided here:
 * <ul>
 * <li>@ref async</li>
 * <li>@ref wildcard</li>
 * <li>@ref qos</li>
 * <li>@ref tracing</li>
 * <li>@ref auto_reconnect</li>
 * <li>@ref offline_publish</li>
 * </ul>

  * This API is thread safe: functions may be called by multiple application
  * threads.
  * Notifications of status and message reception are provided to the client
  * application using callbacks registered with the library by the call to
  * MQTTAsync_setCallbacks() (see MQTTAsync_messageArrived(),
  * MQTTAsync_connectionLost() and MQTTAsync_deliveryComplete()).
  * In addition, some functions allow success and failure callbacks to be set
  * for individual requests, in the ::MQTTAsync_responseOptions structure.  Applications
  * can be written as a chain of callback functions. Note that it is a theoretically
  * possible but unlikely event, that a success or failure callback could be called
  * before function requesting the callback has returned.  In this case the token
  * delivered in the callback would not yet be known to the application program (see
  * Race condition for MQTTAsync_token in MQTTAsync.c
  * https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444093)
  *
  * @page auto_reconnect Automatic Reconnect
  * The ability for the client library to reconnect automatically in the event
  * of a connection failure was added in 1.1.  The connection lost callback
  * allows a flexible response to the loss of a connection, so almost any
  * behaviour can be implemented in that way.  Automatic reconnect does have the
  * advantage of being a little simpler to use.
  *
  * To switch on automatic reconnect, the connect options field
  * automaticReconnect should be set to non-zero.  The minimum and maximum times
  * before the next connection attempt can also be set, the defaults being 1 and
  * 60 seconds.  At each failure to reconnect, the retry interval is doubled until
  * the maximum value is reached, and there it stays until the connection is
  * successfully re-established whereupon it is reset.
  *
  * When a reconnection attempt is successful, the ::MQTTAsync_connected callback
  * function is invoked, if set by calling ::MQTTAsync_setConnected.  This allows
  * the application to take any actions needed, such as amending subscriptions.
  *
  * @page offline_publish Publish While Disconnected
  * This feature was not originally available because with persistence enabled,
  * messages could be stored locally without ever knowing if they could be sent.
  * The client application could have created the client with an erroneous broker
  * address or port for instance.
  *
  * To enable messages to be published when the application is disconnected
  * ::MQTTAsync_createWithOptions must be used instead of ::MQTTAsync_create to
  * create the client object.  The ::createOptions field sendWhileDisconnected
  * must be set to non-zero, and the maxBufferedMessages field set as required -
  * the default being 100.
  *
  * ::MQTTAsync_getPendingTokens can be called to return the ids of the messages
  * waiting to be sent, or for which the sending process has not completed.
  *
  * @page wildcard Subscription wildcards
  * Every MQTT message includes a topic that classifies it. MQTT servers use
  * topics to determine which subscribers should receive messages published to
  * the server.
  *
  * Consider the server receiving messages from several environmental sensors.
  * Each sensor publishes its measurement data as a message with an associated
  * topic. Subscribing applications need to know which sensor originally
  * published each received message. A unique topic is thus used to identify
  * each sensor and measurement type. Topics such as SENSOR1TEMP,
  * SENSOR1HUMIDITY, SENSOR2TEMP and so on achieve this but are not very
  * flexible. If additional sensors are added to the system at a later date,
  * subscribing applications must be modified to receive them.
  *
  * To provide more flexibility, MQTT supports a hierarchical topic namespace.
  * This allows application designers to organize topics to simplify their
  * management. Levels in the hierarchy are delimited by the '/' character,
  * such as SENSOR/1/HUMIDITY. Publishers and subscribers use these
  * hierarchical topics as already described.
  *
  * For subscriptions, two wildcard characters are supported:
  * <ul>
  * <li>A '#' character represents a complete sub-tree of the hierarchy and
  * thus must be the last character in a subscription topic string, such as
  * SENSOR/#. This will match any topic starting with SENSOR/, such as
  * SENSOR/1/TEMP and SENSOR/2/HUMIDITY.</li>
  * <li> A '+' character represents a single level of the hierarchy and is
  * used between delimiters. For example, SENSOR/+/TEMP will match
  * SENSOR/1/TEMP and SENSOR/2/TEMP.</li>
  * </ul>
  * Publishers are not allowed to use the wildcard characters in their topic
  * names.
  *
  * Deciding on your topic hierarchy is an important step in your system design.
  *
  * @page qos Quality of service
  * The MQTT protocol provides three qualities of service for delivering
  * messages between clients and servers: "at most once", "at least once" and
  * "exactly once".
  *
  * Quality of service (QoS) is an attribute of an individual message being
  * published. An application sets the QoS for a specific message by setting the
  * MQTTAsync_message.qos field to the required value.
  *
  * A subscribing client can set the maximum quality of service a server uses
  * to send messages that match the client subscriptions. The
  * MQTTAsync_subscribe() and MQTTAsync_subscribeMany() functions set this
  * maximum. The QoS of a message forwarded to a subscriber thus might be
  * different to the QoS given to the message by the original publisher.
  * The lower of the two values is used to forward a message.
  *
  * The three levels are:
  *
  * <b>QoS0, At most once:</b> The message is delivered at most once, or it
  * may not be delivered at all. Its delivery across the network is not
  * acknowledged. The message is not stored. The message could be lost if the
  * client is disconnected, or if the server fails. QoS0 is the fastest mode of
  * transfer. It is sometimes called "fire and forget".
  *
  * The MQTT protocol does not require servers to forward publications at QoS0
  * to a client. If the client is disconnected at the time the server receives
  * the publication, the publication might be discarded, depending on the
  * server implementation.
  *
  * <b>QoS1, At least once:</b> The message is always delivered at least once.
  * It might be delivered multiple times if there is a failure before an
  * acknowledgment is received by the sender. The message must be stored
  * locally at the sender, until the sender receives confirmation that the

  * the message must be sent again.
  *
  * <b>QoS2, Exactly once:</b> The message is always delivered exactly once.
  * The message must be stored locally at the sender, until the sender receives
  * confirmation that the message has been published by the receiver. The
  * message is stored in case the message must be sent again. QoS2 is the
  * safest, but slowest mode of transfer. A more sophisticated handshaking
  * and acknowledgement sequence is used than for QoS1 to ensure no duplication
  * of messages occurs.

* @page tracing Tracing
  *
  * Runtime tracing can be controlled by environment variables or API calls.
  *
  * #### Environment variables
  *
  * Tracing is switched on by setting the MQTT_C_CLIENT_TRACE environment variable.
  * A value of ON, or stdout, prints to stdout, any other value is interpreted as a file name to use.
  *
  * The amount of trace detail is controlled with the MQTT_C_CLIENT_TRACE_LEVEL environment
  * variable - valid values are ERROR, PROTOCOL, MINIMUM, MEDIUM and MAXIMUM
  * (from least to most verbose).
  *
  * The variable MQTT_C_CLIENT_TRACE_MAX_LINES limits the number of lines of trace that are output
  * to a file.  Two files are used at most, when they are full, the last one is overwritten with the
  * new trace entries.  The default size is 1000 lines.
  *
  * #### Trace API calls
  *
  * MQTTAsync_traceCallback() is used to set a callback function which is called whenever trace
  * information is available.  This will be the same information as that printed if the
  * environment variables were used to control the trace.
  *
  * The MQTTAsync_setTraceLevel() calls is used to set the maximum level of trace entries that will be
  * passed to the callback function.  The levels are:
  * 1. ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_MAXIMUM
  * 2. ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_MEDIUM
  * 3. ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_MINIMUM
  * 4. ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_PROTOCOL
  * 5. ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_ERROR
  * 6. ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_SEVERE
  * 7. ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_FATAL
  *
  * Selecting ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_MAXIMUM will cause all trace entries at all levels to be returned.
  * Choosing ::MQTTASYNC_TRACE_ERROR will cause ERROR, SEVERE and FATAL trace entries to be returned
  * to the callback function.
  *
  * ### MQTT Packet Tracing
  *
  * A feature that can be very useful is printing the MQTT packets that are sent and received.  To
  * achieve this, use the following environment variable settings:
  * @code
    MQTT_C_CLIENT_TRACE=ON
    MQTT_C_CLIENT_TRACE_LEVEL=PROTOCOL
  * @endcode
  * The output you should see looks like this:
  * @code
    20130528 155936.813 3 stdout-subscriber -> CONNECT cleansession: 1 (0)
    20130528 155936.813 3 stdout-subscriber <- CONNACK rc: 0
    20130528 155936.813 3 stdout-subscriber -> SUBSCRIBE msgid: 1 (0)
    20130528 155936.813 3 stdout-subscriber <- SUBACK msgid: 1
    20130528 155941.818 3 stdout-subscriber -> DISCONNECT (0)
  * @endcode
  * where the fields are:
  * 1. date
  * 2. time
  * 3. socket number
  * 4. client id
  * 5. direction (-> from client to server, <- from server to client)
  * 6. packet details
  *
  * ### Default Level Tracing
  *
  * This is an extract of a default level trace of a call to connect:
  * @code
    19700101 010000.000 (1152206656) (0)> MQTTClient_connect:893

  * @endcode
  * where the fields are:
  * 1. date
  * 2. time
  * 3. thread id
  * 4. function nesting level
  * 5. function entry (>) or exit (<)
  * 6. function name : line of source code file
  * 7. return value (if there is one)
  *
  * ### Memory Allocation Tracing
  *
  * Setting the trace level to maximum causes memory allocations and frees to be traced along with
  * the default trace entries, with messages like the following:
  * @code
    20130528 161819.657 Allocating 16 bytes in heap at file /home/icraggs/workspaces/mqrtc/mqttv3c/src/MQTTPacket.c line 177 ptr 0x179f930

    20130528 161819.657 Freeing 16 bytes in heap at file /home/icraggs/workspaces/mqrtc/mqttv3c/src/MQTTPacket.c line 201, heap use now 896 bytes
  * @endcode
  * When the last MQTT client object is destroyed, if the trace is being recorded
  * and all memory allocated by the client library has not been freed, an error message will be
  * written to the trace.  This can help with fixing memory leaks.  The message will look like this:
  * @code
    20130528 163909.208 Some memory not freed at shutdown, possible memory leak
    20130528 163909.208 Heap scan start, total 880 bytes
    20130528 163909.208 Heap element size 32, line 354, file /home/icraggs/workspaces/mqrtc/mqttv3c/src/MQTTPacket.c, ptr 0x260cb00
    20130528 163909.208   Content
    20130528 163909.209 Heap scan end
  * @endcode
  * @endcond
